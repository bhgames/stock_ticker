# Stock-ticker

This is my first ever Ember JS app. It uses a Sinatra backend to hit two different Yahoo API endpoints,
one for stock suggestion and the other for historical data. 

Instead of sorting companies by name, since I am using the stock suggestion API, I order them as they
come back from the API because I figure this is in sorting order of apparent importance to the search algo.

And indeed, in using it, it does appear most relevant matches at the top.
